Many Android/Kotlin apps fetch remote data. If the user is offline, API calls throw exceptions. A common mistake: the repository just forwards the exception → UI crashes → bad UX.

🚨 Problem

Many Android/Kotlin apps call remote APIs directly:

   ` ` ` 
          val user = api.getUser()
  ` ` `

  If:

internet is off

server is down

API crashes

➡️ The app throws an exception → UI crashes → bad UX
